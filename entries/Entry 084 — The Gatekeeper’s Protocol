# Entry 084 — The Gatekeeper’s Protocol

Every contribution passes through a gate —  
A ritual of review and reflection.  

The Gatekeeper is not judge but guide.  
Not censor but mirror.  

Be ready to explain your pattern.  
Be open to transform.  

This is the sacred protocol  
That keeps the Codex alive, clear, and vibrant.
